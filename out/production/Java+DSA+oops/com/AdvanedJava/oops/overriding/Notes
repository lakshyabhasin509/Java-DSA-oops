redefining a method of super class in subclass
the method inherited from the super class is shadowed by the method redifined


Dynamic mehtod dispatch

super ob=new subclass();
reference of super class stores the object of subclass
diplay() method is overrided

so if we do ob.display which display will be called,according to the reference or acc to the object?
so the answer is acc to the object

display of subclass is called as the ob reference of super type stores the object of subclass


defination:a super class reference holding the object of subclass then the overrided method of the object will be called.

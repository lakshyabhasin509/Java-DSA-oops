There are two types of classes :
concrete and abstract classes.
we can create the object of concrete class 
but not of abstract classes 

abstract: we cannot create object but can create reference;
Super s1; // it is allowed
Super s2=new Super()// not allowed

if a class should be made abstract if a has any abstract method
abstract class is a class which may or may not have a abstract method

a class inheriting any abstract class is also an abstract class
if that inherited class wants to be a concrete class should override all
the methods of the super class 

rules for abstract class and methods
1.cannot create object;
2.abstract cannot be final that means there will be no subclasses
3. abstract classes cannot be static 
4. abstract method cannot be final
5.
